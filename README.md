# Understand your code with Machine Learning on Source Code

Workshop given at [DevFest Nantes 2019](https://devfest.gdgnantes.com/sessions/understand_your_code_with_machine_learning_on_source_code/).

<summary>Abstract</summary>

> Machine Learning on Source Code (MLonCode) is an emerging and exciting research domain which stands at the sweet spot between deep learning, natural language processing, social science, and programming.
>
> During this 2 hours workshop, we are going to show you how to extract insights from code bases—step by step—by shedding light on those crucial aspects:
>
> - What information is available in your code
> - How to extract this information
> - What can you do with this knowledge: what are the tasks solvable by MLonCode
> - Which models can be used to solve them
>
> To get our hands dirty, we will solve several example tasks, using source{d}, an open source stack to gain insights from codebases:
>
> - Suggest function names automatically
> - Cluster developers
> - Search projects by similarity
>
> Prerequisites: a laptop with Docker installed. We will provide an image to all participants.
